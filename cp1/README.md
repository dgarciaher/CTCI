# Problems from chapter one

1.1
* I: Create an algorithm that will check if a string contains all unique characters.
* D: Goal is to determine whether at least one character of a string is found more than one time.
* E&A:

  Step 1:
  
    * "abcd" -> true
    * "abbd" -> false
      
  Step 2:
 
     * traversed the whole string and used i and i+1 in a nested for loop to check that not one character was equal to another, and as soon as an instance was found, it stops and returns false.
     
  Step 3: 
      
      
     * for loops used 
     * no need to store data
     
     Step 4:
     
     * "abc"
      * a=b false
      * a=c false
      * b=c false
      * return true
     
     Step 5: 
     
     * code in folder
     
     Step 6:
     
     * "abcd"
     * "abbc"
     * "a3io"
     * "3bbc"
     * "a"
     * " "
     
     Step 7:
     
     * Make sure to have exeptions for empty strings and strings with characters that are not a-z. Also be able to handle really long strings and one character strings.


* L: Strategy works for all cases with added exeptions.
